_Pair-Wise Differential Expression Analysis_

There were 1623 DEG's between all petiole and trap samples.

There were 0, 174, and 151 DEGs identified between prey and no prey treatments at 5 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr time points, respectively. 

_Time-Structured Gene Expression Profiles_

Time series analysis for traps with prey included time points at 5 min, 1 hr, 3 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr. The 0 time point was exluded from this analysis because the regression model did not converge when included. 1463 genes out of 18926 genes with influential data were removed from the Prey Time Series Analysis. 6924 genes out of 17463 genes were identified as differentially expressed. 5 time-structured clusters were idenitified with 744, 594, 123, 140, and 149 genes in each cluster, respecively.

Time series analysis for mechanically triggered traps  included time points at 0 min, 5 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr. 240 genes out of 18592 genes with influential data were removed from the analysis. 2475 genes out of 18352 genes were identified as differentially expressed. 2 time-structured clusters were idenitified with 279 and 434 genes in each cluster, respecively.
