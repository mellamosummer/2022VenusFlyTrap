MethodsTrimmomatic (version 0.39) was used for quality trimming and adapter clipping(citations). Sequencing reads were visualized for quality using FASTQC (version 0.11.9) & MultiQC (version 1.8) before and after trimming  (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016). Trimmed reads were pseudo-aligned to the Dionaea muscipula reference transcriptome index then quantified using Kallisto (version 0.46.1) (Bray et al., 2016). A principal component analysis (PCA) was generated using the R software package Sleuth to visualize the variance between sample groups and replicates (Pimentel et al., 2017). Kallisto transcript abundances were then used for pair-wise differential gene expression analyses across organs (leaf vs. petiole) and shared time points between treatments (prey vs. no prey treatments at 5 min, 1 hr, & 24 hr).To further explore genes involved in the trap mechanism, time series analysis was performed using maSigPro for both prey (5 min,1 hr, 3 hr,12 hr,24 hr,48 hr, 72 hr) and no prey (0 min, 5 min, 1 hr, 24 hr) conditions (Conesa et al., 2006). This method assigns differentially expressed genes to statistically significant time profiles. A cluster analysis using a k-means clustering approach was used to group differentially expressed genes by similar profiles. Cluster number was determined by visually inspecting profiles for a range of k values.Differentially expressed transcripts were translated using seqkit and protein sequences were BLASTed against a custom database of annotated Arabidopsis proteins (Araport11_pep_20220914) and the SwissProt database (Shen et al., 2016; Berardini et al., 2015; Bairoch & Boeckmann, 1994).Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the web-based application, GOrilla, with the arabidopsis protein homologs of the Dionaea muscipula transcriptome as a background set and the Arabidopsis protein homolog of each time point by condition as the target set.Scripts for analyses can be found at www.github.com/mellamosummer/2022VenusFlyTrap/tree/main/Cleaned_Workflow/Scripts.CitationsAndrews, S.
