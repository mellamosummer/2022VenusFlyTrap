MethodsTrimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) was used for quality trimming and adapter clipping. Sequencing reads were visualized for quality using FASTQC v0.11.9 (Andrews, 2010) & MultiQC v1.8 (Ewels et al., 2016) before and after trimming.Trimmed reads were pseudo-aligned to the D. muscipula reference transcriptome index then quantified using Kallisto v0.46.1 (Bray et al., 2016). A principal component analysis (PCA) was generated using the R software package Sleuth (Pimentel et al., 2017) to visualize the variance between sample groups and replicates. Kallisto transcript abundances were then used for pair-wise differential gene expression analyses across organs (leaf vs. petiole) and shared time points between treatments (prey vs. no prey treatments at 5 min, 1 hr, & 24 hr).To further explore genes involved in the trap mechanism, time series analysis was performed using maSigPro (Conesa et al., 2006) for prey (5 min,1 hr, 3 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr) and no prey (0 min, 5 min, 1 hr, 24 hr) treatment. Outliers were first identified samples for each condition were visualized in a Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot. A single library (JMHK) for a leaf trap collected at 24 hrs for the prey treatment was removed from the analysis. maSigPro uses a two-step regression strategy –first, identifying differentially expressed genes, then clustering DEG’s into significant time-structured profiles. A cluster analysis using a k-means clustering approach was used to group differentially expressed genes by similar profiles. Cluster number was determined by visually inspecting profiles for a range of k values.Differentially expressed transcripts were translated using SeqKit (Shen et al., 2016) and protein sequences were BLASTed against a custom database of annotated Arabidopsis thaliana proteins (Araport11_pep_20220914) from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (Berardini et al., 2015) and the Swiss-Prot database (Bairoch & Boeckmann, 1994).Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the web-based application, Gorilla (Eden et al., 2009), with A. thaliana protein homologs of the D. muscipula transcriptome as a background set and the A. thaliana protein homologs for each time point by treatment as the target set.Scripts and results for these analyses can be found at: www.github.com/mellamosummer/2022VenusFlyTrap/tree/main/Cleaned_WorkflowCitationsAndrews, S.
