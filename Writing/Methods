Methods

Trimmomatic was used for quality trimmming and adapter clipping(citations). Sequencing reads were visualized for quality using FASTQC & MultiQC before and after trimming (citations). 

Trimmed reads were pseudo-aligned to the Dionaea muscipula reference transcriptome index then quantified using Kallisto (citation). A principal component analysis (PCA) was generated using the R software package Sleuth to visualize the variance between sample groups and replicates (citation). Kallisto transcript abundances were then used for pair-wise differential gene expression analyses across organs (leaf vs. petiole) and shared time points between treatments (prey vs. no prey treatments at 5 min, 1 hr, & 24 hr).

To further explore genes involved in the trap mechanism, time series analysis was performed using maSigPro for both prey (5 min,1 hr, 3 hr,12 hr,24 hr,48 hr, 72 hr) and no prey (0 min, 5 min, 1 hr, 24 hr)conditions (citation). This method assigns differentially expressed genes to statistically significant time profiles. A cluster analysis using k-means clustering approach was used to group differentially expressed genes by similar profiles. Cluster number was determined by visually insepecting profiles for a range of k values.

Differentially expressed transcripts were translated using seqkit and protein sequences were BLASTed against a custom database of annotated Arabidopsis proteins (Araport11_pep_20220914) and the SwissProt database.

Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the web-based application, GOrilla, with the arabidopsis protein homologs of the Dionaea muscipula transcriptome as a background set and the Arabidopsis protein homolog of each time point by condition as the target set.
