Read mapping and abundance estimation for transcripts was conducted using Kallisto v (Bray et al., 2016).

R software package maSigPro (Conesa et al., 2006; Nueda et al., 2014)
expression data for patterns across time by fitting each geneâ€™s expression pattern to a polynomial using stepwise regression.

Cross-normalized read counts and a negative binomial distribution for the generalized linear models were used.

For each transcript, maSigPro estimated up to a fourth degree polynomial and tested the fit via ANOVA.

Transcripts that had significantly time-structured expression were retained while all others were removed from further analysis.

In total, _____ transcripts were removed as influential genes.

The remaining transcripts that did show time-dependent expression (n = ) were clustered by fuzzy clustering based on similarity in expression profiles.

An optimal fuzzifier m, a parameter that determines how much clusters can overlap, was calculated in the Mfuzz package (Kumar and Futschik, 2007) of R for each species (m = ).

The number of groups k was determined by choosing a value which minimizes the within-group variance

a k of 8 was used for traps triggered with prey and a k of 2 was used for mechanically triggered traps.

Z-scores of normalized counts were calculated for each gene in each cluster as well as a median cluster expression.
