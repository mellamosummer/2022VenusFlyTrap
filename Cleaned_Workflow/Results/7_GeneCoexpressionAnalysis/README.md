This directory contains Gene Co-Expression Analysis Results for 1) All traps (prey & no prey treatments) & 2) Only traps with prey.

For each analysis the directories are organized as follows:
# QC plots     
  - PCA
  - Module optimization plot
  - F stat & variance plot
# Network modules
  -  Network modules csv: contains list of transcripts & module assignments
  -  Genes in Modules: contains summary of module names & # of genes in each module  
  -  Network Module Plots 
     -  line plots of each cluster
     -  heatmap visualization 
  -  Digestive Enzymes in Network Modules
     -  csvs for different classes of enzymes; contains gene ID, AT gene ID, annotation, & orthogroup info
     -  folder containing the Orthofinder resolved gene trees for each class of enzymes
  -  Digestive Enzyme TPM Graphs
     -  line plots for digestive enzyme genes extracted from all modules)
 # Subnetworks
 - just playing around with the subnetwork feature of the anlaysis
 - direct neighbors of chitinase, lipase, metalloendopeptidase, & serine endopeptidase genes 
    - csv of gene IDs & annotations
    - visualization of subnetworks as well 
 # Powerpoint Slides
  - just some summary slides that I've made to help guide folks through what stood out to me!
