Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Before NNI:     tree length is 1.68444932
	NNI      1: new tree length is 1.66945880
	NNI      2: new tree length is 1.65904230
	NNI      3: new tree length is 1.64542430
	NNI      4: new tree length is 1.64415316
	NNI      5: new tree length is 1.64269738
	Performed 5 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 1.68444932
	SPR      1: new tree length is 1.64117630
	SPR      2: new tree length is 1.63241431
	SPR      3: new tree length is 1.63168862
	SPR      4: new tree length is 1.63158939
	Performed 4 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.99082327
