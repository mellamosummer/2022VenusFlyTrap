Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Before NNI:     tree length is 7.92856381
	NNI      1: new tree length is 7.92116828
	NNI      2: new tree length is 7.91999758
	NNI      3: new tree length is 7.91868952
	Performed 3 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 7.92856381
	SPR      1: new tree length is 7.92116828
	SPR      2: new tree length is 7.91999758
	SPR      3: new tree length is 7.91868952
	Performed 3 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.99013918
